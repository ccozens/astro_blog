# First blog, first post!

## Where I'm at
Hi,
I'm Chris and this is just getting started. I've just finshed the codeacademy full stack engineering pathway and now I'm setting ou on my own, to learn how to actually do things without having my hand held. How you ask? I'm glad you did! I have 3 initial plans:

1. Practice JavaScript. Initially with Wes Bos' [Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/). Later I'll move onto something else. I'm gaining ideas as I go through it (currently on day 4), so maybe I'll follow those up or maybe I'll do something else.
2. Migrate to TypeScript. I've dabbled in TypeScript but didn't want to confuse myself too much as the codeacademy course was all JavaScript. So, I'll follow [Microsoft's intro](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/training/paths/build-javascript-applications-typescript/) and see where I go from there.
3. Start a blog, mostly to generate motivation to keep notes to self. My idea is that as I follow courses, build out this site, and refactor old ones I've built I can keep track of when I've figured out how to do things. Having them on here will render them accessible to me, which will be huegly motivating. I've got a lot of notes in Notion too, which I'll look into porting over via the Notion API at some point.

## This site
This actual site is boilerplate at mo, from the [astro blog tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/). I agonised over how to set this up and then remembered ITS NOT THAT IMPORTANT. So, I wrote a list of things I want to use:

1. react - to be honest I'd like to use svelte as I hear so many good things, but react -> employability. Time for svelte when I'm good with react.
2. Typescript - codeacademy taught in JS. That's not super helfpul.
3. testing
4. CSS - I want to learn basic CSS. The first app I wrote was Tailwind but it doesn't help teach the basics. Styled Components look great, but again I want learn CSS. I might decide this is making too much work for myself.
5. Not create-react-app! I agonised for a while between NextJS and astro and decided I was more excited to learn astro. At this point, I figure learning _anything_ is better than nothing.

...and I'm following the tutorial and here we are, actually online rather than faffing about trying to work out what to do ðŸŽ‰.
